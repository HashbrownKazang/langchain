# MLflow

>[MLflow](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/what-is-mlflow) is a versatile, expandable, 
> open-source platform for managing workflows and artifacts across the machine learning lifecycle. 
> It has built-in integrations with many popular ML libraries, but can be used with any 
> library, algorithm, or deployment tool. It is designed to be extensible, so you can write 
> plugins to support new workflows, libraries, and tools.

## Installation and Setup


```bash
pip install mlflow
```

## Provider materials

`MLflow` provides [several examples](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/tree/master/examples/langchain) for the `LangChain` integration:

- [simple_chain](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/examples/langchain/simple_chain.py)
- [simple_agent](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/examples/langchain/simple_agent.py)
- [retriever_chain](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/examples/langchain/retriever_chain.py)
- [retrieval_qa_chain](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/examples/langchain/retrieval_qa_chain.py)
