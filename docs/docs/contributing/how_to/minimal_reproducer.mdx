# How to craft a minimal reproducible example for LangChain

:::info
This guide is a LangChain-specific adaptation of sklearn's [minimal reproducer guide](https://scikit-learn.org/dev/developers/minimal_reproducer.html).
:::

Whether submitting a bug report, designing a suite of tests, or simply posting a question in the discussions, being able to craft minimal, reproducible examples (or minimal, workable examples) is the key to communicating effectively and efficiently with the community.

There are very good guidelines on the internet such as this [StackOverflow document](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example) or [this blogpost by Matthew Rocklin](https://matthewrocklin.com/minimal-bug-reports) on crafting Minimal Complete Verifiable Examples (referred below as MCVE). Our goal is not to be repetitive with those references but rather to provide a step-by-step guide on how to narrow down a bug until you have reached the shortest possible code to reproduce it.

The first step before submitting a bug report to LangChain is to read the Issue template. It is already quite informative about the information you will be asked to provide.
